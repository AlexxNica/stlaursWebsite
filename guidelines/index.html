		The majority of symposium participants present their research or creative project with a poster. Posters should be approximately four feet wide and three feet tall. Posters can be printed or assembled.

		<p><b>Presenters must be available to discuss their displays during their assigned poster session.</b> A few specifics on the poster boards: posters must be readable from at least three feet away, the presentation title must be at least two inches high, and beneath the title, the name(s) of the student author(s), faculty advisor, and home institution must be at least one inch high. STLAURS reserves the right to cancel a presenter's poster session if the above requirements are not met. Sticky tack will be provided.</p>

		<div class="boldUnderline">Oral Presentations</div>
		Students have the option of submitting their application as an oral presentation, and a small number will be invited to do so.  Those who are not invited to give an oral presentation will automatically be considered applicants for a poster presentation.  Oral presentations should be 8-10 minutes in length with five additional minutes for a question-and-answer period. PowerPoint may be used. Speakers who are confirmed for their presentation should make arrangements with Elisabeth Jones to make sure their presentation formats will work. Speakers are highly encouraged to arrive early to the event to confirm that all A/V materials are compatible and working for their specific presentation.  Laptops and projectors will be provided.

		<p>Due to space limitations, only a limited number of students requesting to give oral talks will be invited to do so. Presentations will be chosen based on the quality of the abstract and research, and on variety from the perspective of the entire event and highlighting work from each participating institution.</p>
